From scratch cobbled together C++ code for a takehome challenge over the course of 6 days and after an ~8 year break from C++. Lots of stuff wrong with the code (both in terms of style as well as functionality) but it still roughly solves the requested problem.

For a better impression on what my production code looks like, I recommend checking out the following repos in my Github:

- [EnumPP](https://github.com/nonergodic/) for a rather dated but still useful C++ example
- [Solana AMM](https://github.com/nonergodic/swim-Solana-AMM) for a Rust example
- [ETH AMM](https://github.com/nonergodic/swim-mainrepo/tree/master/packages/evm-contracts) for EVM and TypeScript samples
- [AMM math documentation](https://github.com/nonergodic/swim-mainrepo/tree/master/docs/poolmath) for Python, Jupyter, and math examples
